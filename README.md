# Keep_It_Safe
It is an encryption system, developed using python(3) (back-end) and Visual Basic(front-end) that encrypts any kind of digital file using two layers of encryption (xor and AES). It can be used to keep, store and share files safely.
In its second version, it segments the encrypted file into multiple parts and then stores it to provide more safety.
